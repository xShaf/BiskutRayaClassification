            <li>500g wheat flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons margarine (melted)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Cold water (as needed)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Glue Mixture (for brushing)</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>Cornstarch + cooking oil (mix until texture resembles condensed milk)</li>
            <li>Powdered sugar (for coating)</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li><strong>Prepare the dough:</strong> Melt margarine. Pour into wheat flour. Mix well until it resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li><strong>Form the dough:</strong> Dissolve salt in water and add cold water little by little until it forms a non-sticky dough. Let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the glue mixture:</strong> Combine cornstarch and cooking oil. Mix well until it reaches a condensed milk-like consistency. <em>(No exact measurements needed - aim for not too thick nor too thin)</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Shape the cookies:</strong> Roll dough thinly, cut neatly, brush with glue mixture, then roll up. Cut the rolled dough into small pieces and flatten slightly.</li>
            <li><strong>Frying:</strong> Fry in moderately hot oil until crispy. Drain using a strainer, then place on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Finishing:</strong> When completely cooled, coat the kuih tiram with powdered sugar.</li>

        <h1>History of Kuih Tiram</h1>
        <p>Kuih Tiram, named after its distinctive oyster-shell shape (<em>tiram</em> means "oyster" in Malay), is a traditional crispy wafer cookie that originated from the <strong>Malay communities</strong> of Peninsular Malaysia. Unlike its name suggests, it contains no seafood but gets its signature texture from a unique cornstarch glue coating.</p>

    <h2>Origins & Cultural Significance</h2>

        <p><strong>1. Coastal Inspiration (19th Century)</strong><br>
        First created in <strong>Malacca and Selangor</strong> coastal towns, where oyster shells were abundant. The folded shape mimicked oyster shells found at local markets, making it a creative example of culinary symbolism.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Royal Kitchen Heritage</strong><br>
        Some food historians trace kuih tiram to <strong>Malay royal kitchens</strong>, where intricate folding techniques were perfected. The cornstarch glue method (<em>gam</em>) was developed to create its signature crispness without eggs, making it different from Western wafers.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Festival Staple</strong><br>
        Became a must-have for <strong>Hari Raya</strong> because its long shelf life suited festive preparations. The powdered sugar coating symbolizes purity and celebration, while the golden-brown color represents prosperity.</p>
